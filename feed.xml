People are the key to successful software. IRIS-HEP aims to promote the development of advanced research software skills by providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to connect with mentors within the larger High Energy Physics (HEP) and Computational/Data Science community. At the same time, we aim to promote software as a collaborative activity and encourage collaborations which engage individuals in ways that maximize their potential and their potential impact on the community.</p>

The war made huge adjustments to today‚Äôs science of Ukraine. It became impossible to stay in laboratories all the time; the science funding has even been reduced.<br />
Many Ukrainian scholars remain confined in the country, so they need different types of remote opportunities.</p>

<p>That is why the <strong>SisBioUa</strong> team is working on creating opportunities for Ukrainian scientists: both on-site and remote ones.

<p>We are working on mechanisms to make it happen but it is in progress as legal background for this kind of employment abroad is not developed for academic institutions. We will contact you in case we have questions or updates.</p>

<p>If you were invited for on-site position but cannot accept this offer because you cannot or do not wish to leave Ukraine, please tell them about this activity and feel free to include me into the loop - maybe by that time we will have some updates.</p>
